# 🚀 Offline Ticketing System API for an Organization

---

## 📝 Description

This project is a backend Web API for an offline ticketing system used by an organization to handle internal support requests.  
It is built with **.NET 9**, **Entity Framework Core**, and follows **Clean Architecture** principles.  
The API uses **FastEndpoints** for endpoint management, **MediatR** for CQRS and request/response handling, and is fully role-based (Employee/Admin).  
All endpoints are protected using **JWT authentication**.

---

## 🌟 Features

- **User Roles:** `Employee` and `Admin`
- **Authentication:** JWT-based login (`POST /auth/login`)
- **Ticket Management:** Create, view, update, assign, and delete tickets
- **Statistics:** Get ticket counts by status
- **RESTful API:** Follows best practices
- **Clean Architecture:** Separation of Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and API layers
- **FastEndpoints:** Modern, performant endpoint framework
- **MediatR:** Used for CQRS, decoupling request handling and business logic

## 📚 API Endpoints

### 🔐 Authentication

- `POST /auth/login`  
  Authenticate with email and password, receive JWT token.

- `GET /tickets`  
  List all tickets (**Admin only**)

- `PUT /tickets/{id}`  
  Update ticket status and assignment (**Admin only**)

- `GET /tickets/stats`  
  Show ticket counts by status (**Admin only**)

- `GET /tickets/{id}`

## 📝 Ticket Creation Example

The request model for creating a ticket is:

```csharp
public class CreateTicketRequest
{
    public const string Route = "tickets";

    public string? Title { get; set; }
    public string? Description { get; set; }
    public short? PriorityId { get; set; }
}
```

**Example Request:**

```sh
curl -X POST https://localhost:7073/tickets \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {JWT_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Printer Issue","description":"Printer not working","priorityId":3}'
```

## 🛠️ How to Run the Project

### ▶️ Run Locally

1. **Prerequisites:**  
   - [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)
   - SQLite (no setup required, database file will be created automatically)

2. **Build and Run:**  
   Open a terminal in the project root and run:
   ```sh
   dotnet build
   dotnet run --project src/TicketingSystem.WebApi
   ```
   The API will be available at:  
   `https://localhost:7073`  
   `http://localhost:5031`

3. **API Documentation:**  
   Swagger UI is available at [`/swagger`](https://localhost:7073/swagger) for interactive API testing.

---

### 🐳 Run with Docker

1. **Build Docker Image:**
   ```sh
   docker build -t ticketing-system-api .
   ```

2. **Run Docker Container:**
   ```sh
   docker run -p 7073:7073 ticketing-system-api
   ```

3. The API will be available at:  
   `http://localhost:7073`  
   `https://localhost:7073`

> **Note:**  
> The SQLite database file will be created inside the container.  
> You can mount a volume for persistence if needed.

---

## 🌱 Seeding the Database

On first run, the database is seeded with:

- **Admin User:**  
  - Email: `admin@site.com`  
  - Password: `Ad@123`

- **Employee User:**  
  - Email: `emp@site.com`  
  - Password: `Em@123`

You can use these credentials for login and testing.

---

## ⚡ Assumptions & Decisions

- Passwords are securely hashed.
- JWT secret and database connection string are configured in `appsettings.json`.
- Only Admins can assign tickets and update their status.
- Employees can only view and manage their own tickets.
- SQLite is used for simplicity and local development.
- The project uses Clean Architecture, FastEndpoints, and MediatR for scalability and maintainability.

- `.NET 9`
- `ASP.NET Core Web API`
- `Entity Framework Core`
- `FastEndpoints`
- `MediatR`
